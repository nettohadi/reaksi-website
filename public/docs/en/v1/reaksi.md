# What is Reaksi ?

Reaksi is a UI library that uses the concept of virtual dom. It is heavily inspired 
by React and follows its API very closely.

Reaksi means "Reaction" in Indonesian language. As the creator and an Indonesian, 
Reaksi is my reaction to React. I create Reaksi to understand how React works under 
the hood and to learn more about JavaScript. 

During the process of writing Reaksi, I discovered a lot of insights about React, 
things that I'll never understand if I didn't try to recreate React.

In the end, I hope that Reaksi can be an inspiration for others who want to create 
their own UI library. I believe that creating your own library would be a valuable 
experience and makes you a better developer.
